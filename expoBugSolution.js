Debugging uncommon Expo CLI errors often requires a systematic approach. Here's a breakdown of strategies:

1. **Identify the Specific Error:** Carefully examine the error messages from the Expo CLI.  Look for keywords that might point to the root cause (e.g., 'port in use', 'bundler crash', specific dependency issues).

2. **Check for Port Conflicts:** If the error suggests a port conflict, try these steps:
    *   **Stop other applications:**  Ensure that no other applications are using port 19000 (the default Expo port). You can use tools like `netstat -a -b` (Windows) or `lsof -i :19000` (macOS/Linux) to check port usage.
    *   **Specify a different port:**  Use the `--port` flag with the `expo start` command to start the development server on a different port (e.g., `expo start --port 19001`).
    *   **Restart the computer:** In some cases, a simple restart might resolve the issue.

3. **Examine the Metro Bundler Logs:**  Metro provides detailed logs. Check the terminal output carefully for more clues about the error. Look for errors or warnings related to specific packages or code.

4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try the following:
    *   **`expo prebuild`:** Run this command to clear the cache and rebuild the project.
    *   **Delete the `node_modules` directory and reinstall dependencies:**  `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

5. **Check Dependencies:** Check your `package.json` for any dependencies that might be causing conflicts or have known compatibility issues with Expo. Update dependencies or remove problematic ones.

6. **Check Package-Lock.json (or yarn.lock):**  Make sure that this file is up to date with your package.json, and that it's not causing any version conflicts. Consider deleting it and reinstalling your dependencies. 

7. **Restart the Expo CLI:**  Close the terminal where you're running `expo start` and open a new one.

8. **Update Expo CLI:** Make sure that you have the latest version of the Expo CLI by running `expo update`.

9. **Simplify your project:** If the problem persists, try creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the issue. This can help pinpoint the problematic code or dependency.

10. **Examine device-specific settings:** Make sure that you are developing on the correct Android or iOS device/simulator and have the necessary development tools and configuration.
