This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo start` command and might manifest in several ways. One common symptom is the Expo development server failing to start, showing messages related to port conflicts, network issues, or unexpected terminations.  Another sign is that the Metro bundler (the JavaScript bundler Expo uses) may crash or hang during the startup process.  This can be especially problematic when working with large projects or those utilizing many dependencies. The error messages themselves are sometimes vague or unhelpful, making diagnosis difficult.  For instance, you might encounter generic error messages like 'Server crashed' or 'Unexpected token' without a clear indication of the underlying problem.

Example Scenario:
Suppose you're attempting to run `expo start` and receive a message like 'Failed to start development server: Port already in use'. This is a typical sign of a port conflict, but the root cause could be anything from another application using port 19000 (the default for Expo) to a previous instance of the Expo server that failed to shut down cleanly.
